        <p> Each round starts with <b>two tasks</b> for you and the other retailer to perform:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Decide whether you want to engage in a transfer with the other retailer.</li>
            <li> Place an inventory order to satisfy customer demand.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>After you have performed the two tasks, the round proceeds in <b>three stages</b>: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Customer demand for your product is drawn and displayed to you. Customer demand for the other retailer is drawn and displayed to
                the other retailer.
            </li>
            <li> Customer demand for your product is met from the inventory you ordered in task (2). Customer demand for the other retailer's product
                is met from the other retailer's inventory ordered in task (2).
            </li>
            <li> If you or the other retailer face excess demand or excess inventory and both of you decided to engage in a transfer in task (1),
                excess demand and excess inventory will be matched and transferred as described before. The transfer will be carried out
                automatically.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p> At the end of each round, you will see your earnings from your decisions in that round. </p>
