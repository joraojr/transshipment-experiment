    <p> In each round <b>you</b> and the other retailer have to <b>place an inventory order</b> to satisfy customer demand. </p>

    <p>After you have placed the inventory order, the round proceeds in <b>three stages</b>: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Customer demand for your product is drawn and displayed to you. Customer demand for the other retailer is drawn and displayed to
            the other retailer.
        </li>
        <li> Customer demand for your product is met from your inventory order. Customer demand for the other retailer's product is met from the other
            retailer's inventory order.
        </li>

        {#        <li> If you or the other retailer face excess demand or excess inventory and both of you decide to engage in a transfer, excess demand and#}
        {#            excess inventory will be matched and transferred as described before. The transfer will be carried out automatically.#}
        {#        </li>#}

        <li>
            If you or the other retailer face excess demand or excess inventory, excess demand and excess inventory can be matched and transferred as
            described before. The transfer will be carried out automatically.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p> At the end of each round, you will see your earnings from your decisions in that round. </p>

    <p><b>Your rounds will be timed</b>. You will have a limited amount of time to make your decisions and the times to perform each stage will be
        presented <b>at the beginning of Part 3</b>.</p></p>

    <p> At the end of Part 3, <b>{{ draw_earnings_num_rounds }} rounds </b> will be drawn randomly and the <b>average earnings in ECU </b> from those
        rounds will be converted to Pounds and added to the experiment payout at a rate of <b>{{ conversion_rate }} ECU = Â£1</b>.</p>
