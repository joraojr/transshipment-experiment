    <p> In each round <b>you</b> and the other retailer have to <b>place an inventory order</b> to satisfy customer demand. </p>

    <p>After you have placed the inventory order, the round proceeds in <b>three stages</b>: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Customer demand for your product is drawn and displayed to you. Customer demand for the other retailer is drawn and displayed to
            the other retailer.
        </li>
        <li> Customer demand for your product is met from your inventory order. Customer demand for the other retailer's product is met from the other
            retailer's inventory order.
        </li>

        <li> If you or the other retailer face excess demand or excess inventory and both of you decide to engage in a transfer, excess demand and
            excess inventory will be matched and transferred as described before. The transfer will be carried out automatically.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p> At the end of each round, you will see your earnings from your decisions in that round. </p>

    <p><b>Your rounds will be timed</b>. You will have a limited amount of time to make your decisions.</p>

    <p> At the end of Part 3, <b>{{ draw_earnings_num_rounds }} rounds </b> will be drawn randomly and your payout will be equal to the <b> average
        earnings in ECU </b> from those rounds. </p>
