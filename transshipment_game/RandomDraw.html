    <p>Now,<b> {{ DRAW_EARNINGS_NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds</b> will be drawn randomly to define your payout. </p>

    <p> Your payout will be equal to the <b> {{ show_up_fee }} fixed participation fee </b> and an additional <b>average earnings in ECU from those
        {{ DRAW_EARNINGS_NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds</b> .</p>

    <p> Your average earning in ECU will be converted to Pounds at a rate of <b>{{ conversion_rate }} ECU = Â£1</b>.

    <p> In case you have a negative average earning in ECU, only the fixed participation fee will you be paid to you. <b> That means that your minimum
        payout for the experiment is {{ show_up_fee }}</b></p>
