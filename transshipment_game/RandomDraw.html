    <p>Now,<b> {{ DRAW_EARNINGS_NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds</b> will be drawn randomly to define your payout. </p>

    <p> Your payout will be <b>equal to the average earnings in ECU from those rounds</b> and an <b>additional {{ show_up_fee }}</b> show-up fee.</p>

    <p> Your average earning in ECU will be converted to Euros at a rate of <b>{{ conversion_rate }} ECU = â‚¬1</b>.

    <p> In case you have a negative average earning in ECU, only the show-up will you be paid to you. <b> That means that your minimum payout for the
        experiment is {{ show_up_fee }}</b></p>
