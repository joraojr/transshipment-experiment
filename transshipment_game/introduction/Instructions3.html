    <p> In each round, you and the other retailer have <b>two tasks</b>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Decide whether you want to engage in a transfer with the other retailer, in case you face excess demand or excess inventory.</li>
        <li> Place an inventory order to satisfy customer demand.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>After you have performed the two tasks, the round proceeds in <b>three stages</b>: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Customer demand for your product will be drawn and displayed to you. Customer demand for the other retailer will be drawn and displayed to
            the other retailer.
        </li>
        <li> Customer demand for your product will be satisfied from the inventory you ordered in task (2). Customer demand for the other retailer's
            product
            will be satisfied from the other retailer's inventory ordered in task (2).
        </li>
        <li> If you or the other retailer face excess demand or excess inventory and both of you decided to engage in a transfer in task (1), excess
            demand
            and excess inventory will be matched and transferred as described above. The transfer will be carried out automatically.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p> At the end of each round, you will see your earnings from your decisions in that round. </p>

    {#    You can earn from satisfying customer demand: Units sold to customers x retail price - procurement cost per unit x inventory ordered "#}
