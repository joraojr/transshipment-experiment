    <p> At the beginning of Part 2, you will play in a group of two with another participant. In each round, you will be randomly matched to another
        participant. That means you may not be playing with the same participant every round. </p>

    <p> You and the other participant play the role of retailers who sell a single (fictional) product. </p>

    <p>In each round, you and the other retailer face customer demand for your product. Customer demand varies between <b>0 and 200</b> units of the
        product. All demand between <b>0 and 200</b> is equally likely. </p>

    <p>In each round, the demand you and the other retailer face is <b>drawn randomly and independently</b>. That means that demand varies between
        rounds. The demand you and the other retailer face in the same round can be different. </p>

    <p>In each round, before demand is randomly drawn, you and the other retailer can order product units from a supplier at a procurement cost of <b>20
        ECU</b> per unit and sell units to customers at a retail price of <b>40 ECU</b> per unit.</p>

    <p>If you order more units than customers demand, you have excess inventory. You cannot sell excess inventory from the current round in the next
        round.</p>

    <p>If you order fewer units than customers demand, you have excess demand.</p>
