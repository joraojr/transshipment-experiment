    <p>
        Now you play a one-shot Dictator Game.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>

        In this game, one of you will play as the Dictator and the other as the Recipient.

        Prior to making a decision, you will learn your role, which will be randomly assigned.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} to split. The Dictator will decide how much she or he will retain. Then the rest will go to Recipient.
    </p>
