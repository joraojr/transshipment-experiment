    <p> This experiment consists of <b>4 parts </b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> In Part 1, you answer a pre-experiment questionnaire.</li>
        <li> In Part 2, you receive the instructions on the experiment task and answer comprehension questions.</li>
        <li> In Part 3, you play {{ MAIN_GAME_NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds of the experiment task.</li>
        <li> In Part 4, you answer an exit questionnaire.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Your payout from the experiment consists of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> A fixed participation fee of <b>{{ show_up_fee }}</b>.</li>
        <li> A bonus payment that depends on your decisions in <b>Parts 1, Part 3, and Part 4</b> of the experiment. Your decisions in the experiment
            can
            earn you Experimental Currency Units (ECU). Your average earnings in ECU will be converted to Pounds at a rate of <b>{{ conversion_rate }}
                ECU = Â£1 </b> at the end of the experiment and paid out as your bonus.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p> In each Part (1, 3, and 4), you will be informed about how the bonus payment is determined in that part. </p>

    <p> At the end of the experiment, you will be informed how high your bonus payment is.</p>

    <p> In case you have negative average earnings in ECU, only the fixed participation fee will be paid to you. <b> That means that your minimum
        payout for the experiment is {{ show_up_fee }}</b></p>

    <br>


    <p>
        <b>IMPORTANT:</b>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Your payout will be <b>only paid if you complete all parts</b> of the experiment.</li>
