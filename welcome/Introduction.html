    <p> Please proceed through the experiment without taking breaks.</p>

    <p> This experiment consists of <b>4 parts </b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> In Part 1, you answer a pre-experiment questionnaire.</li>
        <li> In Part 2, you receive the instructions on the experiment task and answer comprehension questions.</li>
        <li> In Part 3, you play {{ MAIN_GAME_NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds of the experiment task.</li>
        <li> In Part 4, you answer an exit questionnaire.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> At the end of the experiment, you provide your bank account details, so we can transfer your experiment payout.</p>

    <p> Your payout from the experiment consists of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> A participation fee of <b>{{ show_up_fee }}</b>.</li>
        <li> Earnings from your decisions in the experiment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Your decisions in the experiment can earn you Experimental Currency Units (ECU). </p>

    <p> At the end of Part 3, <b>{{ draw_earnings_num_rounds }} rounds </b> will be drawn randomly and your payout will be equal to the <b> average
        earnings in ECU </b> from those rounds. </p>

    <p> Your average earnings in ECU will be converted to Euros at a rate of <b>{{ conversion_rate }} ECU = â‚¬1</b>. They will be added to the show-up
        fee and paid into your bank account.</p>

    <p> In case you have a negative average earnings in ECU, only the participation fee will be paid to you. <b> That means that your minimum payout for the
        experiment is {{ show_up_fee }}</b></p>
