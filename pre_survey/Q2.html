    <p>
        Imagine this scenario.

    </p>

    <p>
        Imagine a task about dividing money between yourself and another person to whom you are randomly matched. You do not know this other person,
        and you will not knowingly meet the other person.
    </p>

    <p>
        Imagine you have been randomly assigned the role of the "allocator". The other person is in the role of the "recipient".
    </p>

    <p>
        You are endowed with {% C.ENDOWMENT %}, the recipient is endowed with 0 ECU.
    </p>

    <p>

        You can decide how much of your {% C.ENDOWMENT %} endowment to transfer to the recipient.
    </p>

    <p>
        The recipient receives the amount that you decide to transfer to them. You keep the amount that you decide not to transfer.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can choose any amount between 0 ECU and {% C.ENDOWMENT %} to transfer to the recipient.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> How much of your {% C.ENDOWMENT %} endowment do you want to transfer to the recipient? </b>
    </p>

    {% form.sent %}

    <br>

    <p>

        At the end of the experiment, up to <b> {% draw_earnings_dictator %} participants</b> will be selected randomly to receive the amount they <b>decided
        to keep</b>. The amount will be converted to Pounds added to the experiment payout at a rate of <b>{{ conversion_rate }} ECU = Â£1</b>.
