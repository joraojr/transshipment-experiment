    <p>
        Now, you will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of you will be <b>Participant A </b> and the other <b>Participant B</b>. Prior to making a decision, you will learn which Participant you
        are, which will be <b>randomly assigned </b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <b>sum of {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}</b> has been provisionally allocated to each pair. Participant A can propose how much of this each person is to
        receive.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Participant A makes the proposal</b>. The proposal consists of an amount that Participant B is to receive. The amount that Participant A
        is to receive is simply the total amount to be divided, {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}, minus the amount that Participant B is to receive.
    </p>

    <p>

        If you are <b>Participant A</b>, you will be asked to <b>fill out the proposal form</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are <b>Participant B</b>, you will be asked to <b>wait for Participant A to make a proposal</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the end of Part 3, X% of the pairs will be randomly selected to receive the amount proposed by Participant A.
        This means that the proposal of Participant A <b>will be added to the payout of the X% of the pairs randomly selected</b> at a rate of
        <b>{{ conversion_rate }} ECU = Â£1</b>.
    </p>
