    <p>
        Imagine this scenario.

    </p>

    <p>
        Imagine a task about dividing money between yourself and another person to whom you are randomly matched. You do not know this other person,
        and you will not knowingly meet them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Imagine you have been randomly assigned the role of the "allocator". The other person is in the role of the "recipient".
    </p>

    <p>
        You are endowed with {% C.ENDOWMENT %}, the recipient is endowed with 0 ECU.
    </p>

    <p>

        You can decide how much of your {% C.ENDOWMENT %} endowment to transfer to the recipient.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can choose any amount between 0 ECU and {% C.ENDOWMENT %}. The recipient receives the amount that you decide to transfer to them; you
        receive the amount that you decide not to transfer and thus to keep
    </p>



    <p>
        How much of your {% C.ENDOWMENT %} endowment do you want to transfer to the recipient?
    </p>

    {% form.sent %}

    <br>

    <p>

        At the end of the experiment, {% draw_earnings_dictator %} participants will be selected randomly to receive the amount they decided to keep.
        The amount will be converted to pounds added to the experiment payout at a rate of <b>{{ conversion_rate }} ECU = Â£1</b>.
    </p>
